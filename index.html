    <p>
      I lead DesignOps at <a class="light-gray" href="http://accurat.it/">Accurat</a>, a data-driven research, design and innovation agency in Milan, Italy.

      Previously, I lived in Berlin and worked for <a class="light-gray" href="http://mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>. I designed browser experiences for TVs and smart assistants powered by Amazon’s Alexa. I also launched the Firefox Design System to support the not-for-profit multi-platform browser factory.

      I taught Web and Media Design at the M.A. in Eco-Social Design in Bolzano, Italy. During this tenure I co-wrote a piece for <a class="light-gray" href="https://alistapart.com/article/motion-with-meaning-semantic-animation-in-interface-design">A List Apart</a>.

      Between 2010–16 I ran a one-man <a class="light-gray" href="https://studio.aminalhazwani.com/">studio</a> specialized in design for screens. I produced work for Google, Studio Mut, Arillo, Unibz and many more.
